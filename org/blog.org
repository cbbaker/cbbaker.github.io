I needed a place to store links and random notes to myself about things I figured out. I started keeping more meticulous notes in org-mode in Emacs, and I thought it might be nice to push some out onto the web. I settled on using [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]], as I wanted a static site, and [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] exports cleanly to it. We'll see how it goes.
